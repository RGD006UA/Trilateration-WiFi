# EloquentArduino library

This library contains source code and examples from the [eloquentarduino blog](https://eloquentarduino.github.io/),
covering very different topics:

 - data structures
 - image / camera processing
 - print utilities
 - ...other miscellaneous

You can install this library either by cloning the repo or directly from the Arduino IDE Library Manager.
